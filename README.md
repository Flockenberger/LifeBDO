# LifeBDO
LifeBDO is a collection of data for the game Black Desert Online

## JSON and CSV
I have compiled various recipes and items into json and csv files.
They are not all 100% complete but will get more and more done over time.

## "API"
I am currently in the process of writing a simple Java API to get/search Items/Recipes etc. and to do simple calculations for recipes like amount needed, time etc. 
This will be up here soon.

What's also possible is to fetch live market prices, buy and sell items aswell. I know how to do it, I have tried it and I have also reported it to the GMs as I want the game to be fair. BUT I am NOT going to release this, as this would break the game quite a bit.
So do not ask me about this, thanks.
